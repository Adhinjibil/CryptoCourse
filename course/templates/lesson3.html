        <h2>Basics of Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
        <!-- <img src="st4.gif" alt="" > -->
        <p>Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic technique that uses a pair of distinct keys to secure data communication. 
            Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption, asymmetric encryption employs two mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key.
            This approach addresses the challenges of secure key exchange in symmetric encryption and enables a wide range of secure applications.</p>

                    <h2>public Key</h2>
                    <p>
                        The public key is intended to be shared openly and is used for encryption.
It's used by anyone who wants to send an encrypted message to the owner of the public key.</p>
<h2>Private key</h2>
<p>
    The private key is kept confidential and is used for decryption.
Only the owner of the private key can decrypt messages encrypted with their corresponding public key.</p>

            <h2>Real-life Examples of Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
            <p>Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is used in various real-world scenarios to ensure secure communication, authentication, and data integrity. Here are some notable examples</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure Web Communication (HTTPS)</li>
                <li>Digital Signatures</li>
                <li>Secure Email (PGP/GPG)</li>
                <li>SSH (Secure Shell)</li>
                <li>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</li>
                <li>Cryptocurrency Transactions</li>
                <li>Secure Software Distribution</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Understanding the Need for Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
    <p>Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, addresses critical challenges that symmetric encryption faces, making it an essential cryptographic technique in modern digital communication. The need for asymmetric encryption arises due to the limitations of symmetric encryption, particularly in the areas of key exchange and authentication.</p>
    <p><bold>Real-world Applications:</bold>

        The need for asymmetric encryption is evident in various real-world applications, including secure online transactions, digital signatures for legal documents, encrypted email communication, secure remote access, and more.</p>
