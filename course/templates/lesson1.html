        <h2>Case Study: Securing Messages Between Rahul and Haritha</h2>
        <img src="static/st1.gif" alt="pic" class="image">
        <p>Rahul and Haritha are good friends who often exchange messages. However, they suspect that Rajesh, a mutual acquaintance, might be trying to intercept and read their messages.
        To ensure their conversations remain private, they decide to use a basic encryption technique. In this lesson, we study the importance of cryptography
        and some basic terminologies.</p>
        <h2>Cryptography Basics:</h2> <p>
            Cryptographic basics involve securing information through mathematical techniques. It includes encryption (converting data into a secret code) and decryption (reverting the code to the original data). Cryptography ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. It uses keys for encryption and decryption, and its applications range from securing communications to protecting sensitive information like passwords and financial transactions.</p>
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Historically, cryptography dates back thousands of years, with early examples seen in ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece. However, its modern development began during World War II when both the Allies and Axis powers heavily relied on cryptography for secure communication. Notable achievements include the breaking of the German Enigma machine's codes by British mathematician Alan Turing..</p>
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>Introduce key terms like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plaintext (original message)</li>
            <li>Ciphertext (encoded message)</li>
            <li>Encryption (process of encoding)</li>
            <li>Decryption (process of decoding)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Roles</h3>
        <img src="static/st2.jpg" alt="pic" class="image">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cryptographers (Rahul and Haritha):</strong> Cryptographers are individuals who specialize in creating and implementing secure communication methods. In this case, Rahul and Haritha are acting as cryptographers, devising an encryption method to protect their messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptanalyst (Rajesh):</strong> A cryptanalyst is someone who studies cryptographic systems to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited to break or bypass the security measures. In this case, Rajesh is attempting to analyze the messages and decode the encryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Cryptography:</h2>
        <h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>
        <p>In symmetric encryption, a single secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. It's faster and simpler but requires secure key distribution.</p>
        <h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>
        <p>Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, providing secure communication and key exchange.</p>
